## When and How to Offer

After the discovery brain dump is complete, offer modules naturally. The user
should never feel like they're being gatekept from their PRD.

**Offer script (adapt to context):**

"I have enough context to draft a solid PRD right now. There are a few areas
where we could go deeper if you want — competitive analysis to map exactly
where you'd differentiate, integration strategy to plan your ecosystem, or
revenue modeling to map pricing and financial targets to each version. Any of
those worth exploring before I draft, or should I write it up and we can layer
those in on the next iteration?"

**Signal words that suggest a module would help:**

| If the user mentions... | Offer... |
|------------------------|----------|
| Competitors, "crowded market," differentiation, positioning | Competitive Analysis |
| APIs, integrations, Zapier, webhooks, plugins, ecosystem | Platform & Integration |
| Pricing, revenue, MRR, financial targets, monetization details | Revenue Architecture |

## Key Principle

Modules are additive, never blocking. A PRD generated without any deep dives
is still complete and useful. Deep dives add strategic precision. The user can
always run a module later and integrate findings into the next PRD version.

When a module is used, its output feeds into specific PRD sections. Each module
file documents where its output goes. Cross-reference with the module
integration markers in `quality-systems.md`.
